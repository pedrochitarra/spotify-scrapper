## üßê About <a name = "about"></a>
Welcome to the Spotify Scraper repository, an educational resource designed to provide insight into web scraping techniques and data extraction from the Spotify platform. This repository serves as a learning tool for individuals interested in understanding how to programmatically access and retrieve information from Spotify's vast database of music tracks, albums, artists, and playlists.

## üèÅ Getting Started <a name = "getting_started"></a>
The following link provide access to the official documentation for the Spotify Web API, which is the primary resource used to access and retrieve data from the Spotify platform. The documentation provides a comprehensive overview of the API's capabilities, including the various endpoints and methods available for accessing and retrieving data from the Spotify platform.

- [Spotify Web API Documentation](https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api/tutorials/getting-started)

In this repository, you will find a collection of Python scripts and accompanying documentation that demonstrate various methods for scraping data from Spotify's web interface. Whether you're a beginner looking to explore the fundamentals of web scraping or an experienced developer seeking to enhance your skills, this repository aims to provide clear examples and explanations to aid your learning journey.

I'm assuming here that you have a basic understanding of Python and web scraping, also
that you have an access token from Spotify API. If you don't have one, you can get it [here](https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api/concepts/access-token).

It's important to note that while web scraping can be a powerful tool for data acquisition, it's essential to adhere to Spotify's terms of service and usage policies. This repository encourages responsible scraping practices and respects Spotify's guidelines regarding data access and usage. Also this repository is for educational purposes only, and the scripts provided are intended to be used as learning tools to explore the process of web scraping and data extraction.

Whether you're interested in building your own music recommendation system, conducting research on music trends, or simply curious about the process of web scraping, this repository provides a valuable resource to help you get started.

Happy scraping, and enjoy exploring the world of music data with Spotify Scraper!

Since I'm Brazilian, I'm going to gather the playlists of the musics most listened to in Brazil and the cities where the artists are most listened to. There's a group of playlists for a large amount of cities called Top 50 - City Name, from Sound of Cities user. I'm going to gather all the playlists from this user and save the information in a database.

An important thing to note that's all the connections with database are made
to a PostgreSQL database, but to showcase in Streamlit I'm using a SQLite database, since there's not a lot of data to showcase.
